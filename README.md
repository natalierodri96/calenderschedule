# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

The task is to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 
For each hour of the day in the planner we can input an event for that hour. 
But a link for the hours of the day available and create variables. Then created a for loop that interacts with the "data-hours" and create a text space for the events the user create and saving the events in local storage.

this project was super difficult for me. I really didn't know where to start and comparing similar projects sent me through a whirlwind cause there's so many different ways to accomplish this task.
I wanted to stick with what I was somewhat comfortable with and just work within the html code with the script tag. some of the items I can see working like saving the text event. I noticed that my times aren't showing up like 8am, 9am, etc. but I have the 12 timeslots associated with the variables.
