# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

The task is to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 
For each hour of the day in the planner we can input an event for that hour. 
But a link for the hours of the day available and create variables. Then created a for loop that interacts with the "data-hours" and create a text space for the events the user create and saving the events in local storage.
